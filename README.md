# Tamas Ruszka - CV

This is my interactive CV using plain HTML, CSS and JS to make it fancy. You can check out the CV on the following [link](https://tamas-ruszka.com/). The code is custom-tailored for my resume, but I want to create a more programmatic solution for future modifications.

## How to print

Just use your browser's default print prompt window, the website is prepared for printing, and it will look like any other PDF-based CV!

## How to save as a PDF

Just like with printing, you can use the default browser prompt, but instead of sending to a printer, you need to select the save as PDF option.
